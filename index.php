					<b>The University of Macau Library</b> has moved into the current "University of Macau Wu Yee Sun Library” building in July 2014. Standing in the forefront and occupying a very central location of the new campus, and surrounded by a man-made lake and a man-made river, the Library is the landmark building of the whole campus. The main entrance, facing the Library Square, connects with the Central Teaching Building and the Faculties through corridors and bridges. WYS Library is a magnificent building of 7 floors with two lower wings on its sides. The size of the new library is about 30,000 square meters, and is projected to hold one million volumes of books and journals, and to provide some 3,000 seats. The Library was designed by Professor He Jingtang (何鏡堂教授), Academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. In tune with the design principles of the UM campus, it combines the best features of the Chinese and Western cultural elements in its exterior. Looking from outside, it exudes learning and scholarship, just like any great university library anywhere in the world, and at the same time, it projects warmth and beams welcome on its visitors.
